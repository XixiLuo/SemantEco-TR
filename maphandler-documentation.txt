As for map handler, that was probably an incorrect term to use. I'm
referring to the two methods that a data provider module uses to
identify icons and whether a marker should be visible or not. When any
data provider (e.g. the SpeciesDataProviderModule) initializes, it
calls those methods on the DataTypeModule so the module knows how to
render content on the map. This is what I mean about how the different
modules interact and as the code is currently written you can't choose
them piecemeal from index.jsp the way Robin has gone about it. If you
wanted all of the immediate functionality you would have implemented
it in the same way as the debugger.
